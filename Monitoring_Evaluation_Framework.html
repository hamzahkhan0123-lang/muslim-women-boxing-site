    <h2>Monitoring &amp; Evaluation Framework</h2>
    
    <!-- Introductory Context -->
    <p>
        Monitoring and evaluation are essential to ensure this initiative achieves its intended outcomes and aligns with UK sport development standards.
        This framework connects directly to our <strong>logic model</strong>, measuring progress towards increased participation, improved wellbeing, and social inclusion.
        Indicators have been selected based on <em>Sport England evaluation guidelines</em> and sociological principles of empowerment and equity.
    </p>

    <!-- Policy and Sociological Context -->
    <p><strong>Policy Alignment:</strong> This approach reflects priorities in the <em>Sport England Strategy (2021–2031)</em> and local authority health and wellbeing plans.</p>
    <p><strong>Sociological Rationale:</strong> Indicators such as retention and satisfaction address barriers to participation and give voice to underrepresented groups.</p>
