  <h2>Muslim Women in Boxing: Inclusion and Policy</h2>

  <h3>What’s Good</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Highlights the challenge of religious inclusion in a traditionally male-dominated sport.</li>
    <li>Recognizes policy reforms such as allowing hijabs and modest attire in amateur and professional boxing.</li>
    <li>Emphasizes the importance of representation and participation for Muslim women.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What’s Missing</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>No reference to UK sport agencies that shape inclusion:
      <ul>
        <li>https://www.sportengland.org/Sport England</a></li>
        <li><a href="ww.uksport.gov.uk/UK Sport</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.activepartnershipsve Partnerships</a></li>
        <li>https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/Birmingham City Council</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.sportingg.uk/Sporting Equals</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>No explanation of policy interaction:
      <p>
        Sport England’s 
        https://www.sportengland.org/why-we-exist/uniting-the-movement
          Uniting the Movement strategy
        </a> 
        promotes diversity across all sports, including boxing.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>Lack of real-world initiatives:
      <p>
        Programs by 
        https://www.sportingequals.org.uk/
          Sporting Equals
        </a> 
        supporting ethnic minority women in sport, and local Birmingham boxing clubs offering female-only sessions and private training.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How to Improve</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Add a section on policy-agency collaboration:
      <p>
        Sport England works with local councils and Active Partnerships to ensure boxing clubs adopt inclusive practices, aligning with equality objectives.
      </p>
