  <h2>Muslim Women in Boxing: Inclusion and Policy</h2>

  <h3>What’s Good</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Highlights the challenge of religious inclusion in a traditionally male-dominated sport.</li>
    <li>Recognizes policy reforms such as allowing hijabs and modest attire in amateur and professional boxing.</li>
    <li>Emphasizes the importance of representation and participation for Muslim women.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What’s Missing</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>No reference to UK sport agencies that shape inclusion:
      <ul>
        <li>Sport England</li>
        <li>UK Sport</li>
        <li>Active Partnerships</li>
        <li>Birmingham City Council</li>
        <li>Sporting Equals</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>No explanation of policy interaction:
      <p>
        Sport England’s <a href="https://www.sportengland.org/why-we-exist/uniting-the-movement" target="_blank">Uniting the Movement strategy</versity across all sports, including boxing.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>Lack of real-world initiatives:
      <p>
        Programs by <a href="https://www.sportingequals.org.uk/" target="_blank">Sporting Equals</a> supporting ethnic minority women in sport, and local Birmingham boxing clubs offering female-only sessions and privatei>
  </ul>

  <h3>How to Improve</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Add a section on policy-agency collaboration:
      <p>Sport England works with local councils and Active Partnerships to ensure boxing clubs adopt inclusive practices, aligning with equality objectives.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Include case studies or quotes from Muslim women boxers.</li>
    <li>Provide links to official strategies:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.sportengland.org/why-we-exist/uniting-the-movement" target="_blank">Sport England – Uniting the Movement</a></tps://www.sportingequals.org.uk/" target="_blank">Sporting>
    </li>
    <li>Suggest practical steps for clubs:
      <ul>
        <li>Female coaches</li>
        <li>Flexible attire rules</li>
        <li>Safe, private training environments</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
