  <h1>Test Page: Muslim Women in Boxing</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Muslim Women in Boxing: Inclusion and Policy</h2>

    <h3>What’s Good</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Highlights the challenge of religious inclusion in a traditionally male-dominated sport.</li>
      <li>Recognizes policy reforms such as allowing hijabs and modest attire in amateur and professional boxing.</li>
      <li>Emphasizes the importance of representation and participation for Muslim women.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What’s Missing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No reference to UK sport agencies that shape inclusion:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.sportengland.org/" target="_i>
          <li>https://www.uksport.gov.uk/UK Sport</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.activepartnerships.org/" target="_/a></li>
          <li>https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/Birmingham City Council</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.sportingequalsporting Equals</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>No explanation of policy interaction:
        <p>
          Sport England’s 
          <a href="https://www.sportengland.org/why-we-exist/uniting-the-movement" targeting the Movement strategy
          </a> 
          promotes diversity across all sports, including boxing.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>Lack of real-world initiatives:
        <p>
          Programs by 
          https://www.sportingequals.org.uk/
            Sporting Equals
          </a> 
          supporting ethnic minority women in sport, and local Birmingham boxing clubs offering female-only sessions and private training.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to Improve</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a section on policy-agency collaboration:
        <p>
          Sport England works with local councils and Active Partnerships to ensure boxing clubs adopt inclusive practices, aligning with equality objectives.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>Include case studies or quotes from Muslim women boxers.</li>
      <li>Provide links to official strategies:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.sportengland.org/why-we-exist/uniting-theSport England – Uniting the Movement</a></li>
          <li>https://www.sportingequals.org.uk/Sporting Equals</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Suggest practical steps for clubs:
        <ul>
          <li>Female coaches</li>
          <li>Flexible attire rules</li>
          <li>Safe, private training environments</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
