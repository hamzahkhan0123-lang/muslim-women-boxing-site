    The initiative aligns with <strong>Sport England’s “Uniting the Movement”</strong> strategy,
    which prioritises inclusion for underrepresented groups. Collaboration with 
    <strong>Active Birmingham</strong>, <strong>Sporting Equals</strong>, and local 
    <strong>faith-based community centres</strong> ensures the initiative complements 
    existing equality frameworks under the <em>Equality Act 2010</em>.
