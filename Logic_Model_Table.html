        This logic model aligns with <em>Sport England’s Uniting the Movement</em> strategy by tackling inequalities in participation. Activities such as female-only sessions and culturally sensitive coaching address intersectional barriers (gender, religion, ethnicity) and issues of social exclusion. Outcomes will be monitored through attendance data and confidence surveys, aiming for a 20% increase in weekly physical activity and an 80% retention rate after 12 weeks.
