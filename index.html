    <h1>How Religious Beliefs Can Affect Participation in Sports – And How to Make Sports More Inclusive</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction and Aims</h2>
        <p>This project explores how religious beliefs, particularly within Islam, influence participation in sports. It aims to identify barriers and propose inclusive strategies that respect religious values while promoting active engagement.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Context</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Modesty requirements (e.g., hijab, long sleeves)</li>
            <li>Gender segregation in physical activities</li>
            <li>Lack of representation (few Muslim female coaches)</li>
            <li>Example: <strong>Muslim Women Boxing Initiative</strong> – empowering Muslim women through culturally sensitive boxing programs</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Critical Theory and Sport</h2>
        <p>Critical theory helps examine power structures and cultural norms in sport. It promotes <strong>agency</strong>—the ability to act independently and make choices—especially for marginalized groups.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Challenges dominant ideologies</li>
            <li>Focuses on empowerment and cultural transformation</li>
            <li>More agency-oriented than functionalism or conflict theory</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Agency</h2>
        <p>Agency refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently. In sport, it means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Muslim women choosing to participate despite societal pressures</li>
            <li>Creating inclusive spaces and programs</li>
            <li>Having Muslim female coaches who advocate for their communities</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Major Tenets of Critical Theory in Sport</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Power and inequality in sport</li>
            <li>Cultural hegemony and marginalization</li>
            <li>Resistance and social change</li>
            <li>Sport as a space for identity and interaction</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Beyond Exploitation</h2>
        <p>Critical theory moves beyond seeing athletes as exploited labor. It views sport as a site for resistance, expression, and transformation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Shaped by Interactions / Shaping Wider Culture</h2>
        <p>Sport is both influenced by and influences culture. Inclusive practices can reshape societal views on Muslim women in sport.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Potential for Change</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Policy reforms (e.g., allowing religious attire)</li>
            <li>Community initiatives (e.g., boxing programs)</li>
            <li>Representation and leadership (e.g., Muslim female coaches)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
